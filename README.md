# derailed
Derailed is a footwear focused clone of [Grailed](https://www.grailed.com/). On the site, users can search through listings to find their grail shoe, hopefully for a price that hasn't gone too off the rails. Once logged in users can create listings of their own, and leave offers on others items for sale.
