size 8.5 US

released in 2006

these are straight from Shae Haley's personal collection

thats right, 1/3 of N*E*R*D

Shae Haley, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo made up the band N*E*R*D

the lineage of these shoes are unmatched

limited to 100 pairs made

major collectors item

these were partially released by raffle at BAPE stores & select streetwear retailers that were chosen by Nigo & Pharrell

the rest were gifted to friends and family

hence Shae owning a pair

patent leather upper

N*E*R*D 'brain' graphic embroidered on the heel

BAPE has since been attempted to retro this colorway, but never with the N*E*R*D 'brain' motif

it is amazing that the patent leather has not been cracked and entirely destroyed considering that they are 16 years old

but that is because they have been properly stored in a climate controlled storage unit that entire time (aside from Shae wearing them once)

pre-owned

no major flaws

light signs of wear / dirt

any visible flaws are shown in pictures

original box NOT included - replacement box will be included

plenty of life left

100% authentic

premium quality
